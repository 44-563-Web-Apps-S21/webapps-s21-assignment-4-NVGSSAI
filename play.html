<h2>Winter's Tale</h2>
<h3>ACT I<br>
 SCENE I<br>
 Antechamber in LEONTES' palace.</h3>
<p>
    ARCHIDAMUS<br>
    If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on<br>
    the like occasion whereon my services are now on<br>
    foot, you shall see, as I have said, great<br>
    difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.<br>
    CAMILLO<br>
    I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia<br>
    means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.<br>
    ARCHIDAMUS<br>
    Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be<br>
    justified in our loves; for indeed--<br>
    CAMILLO<br>
    Beseech you,--<br>
    ARCHIDAMUS<br>
    Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:<br>
    we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know<br>
    not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,<br>
    that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,<br>
    may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse<br>
    us.<br>
    CAMILLO<br>
    You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.<br>
    ARCHIDAMUS<br>
    Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me<br>
    and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.<br>
    CAMILLO<br>
    Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.<br>
    They were trained together in their childhoods; and<br>
    there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,<br>
    which cannot choose but branch now. Since their<br>
    more mature dignities and royal necessities made<br>
    separation of their society, their encounters,<br>
    though not personal, have been royally attorneyed<br>
    with interchange of gifts, letters, loving<br>
    embassies; that they have seemed to be together,<br>
    though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and<br>
    embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed<br>
    winds. The heavens continue their loves!<br>
