    <p class="stage-direction">Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS</p><br>
    <h6 class="name ARCHIDAMUS">ARCHIDAMUS</h6><br>
    <p class="speech">If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on<br>
        the like occasion whereon my services are now on<br>
        foot, you shall see, as I have said, great<br>
        difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.<br></p>
    <h6 class="name CAMILLO">CAMILLO</h6><br>
    <p class="speech">I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia<br>
        means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.<br></p>
    <h6 class="name ARCHIDAMUS">ARCHIDAMUS</h6><br>
    <p class="speech">Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be<br>
        justified in our loves; for indeed--<br></p>
    <h6 class="name CAMILLO">CAMILLO</h6><br>
    <p class="speech">Beseech you,--</p><br>
    <h6 class="name ARCHIDAMUS">ARCHIDAMUS</h6><br>
    <p class="speech">Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:<br>
        we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know<br>
        not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,<br>
        that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,<br>
        may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse<br>
        us.<br></p>
    <h6 class="name CAMILLO">CAMILLO</h6><br>
    <p class="speech">You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.<br></p>
    <h6 class="name ARCHIDAMUS">ARCHIDAMUS</h6><br>
    <p class="speech">Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me<br>
        and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.<br></p>
    <h6 class="name CAMILLO">CAMILLO</h6><br>
    <p class="speech">Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.<br>
        They were trained together in their childhoods; and<br>
        there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,<br>
        which cannot choose but branch now. Since their<br>
        more mature dignities and royal necessities made<br>
        separation of their society, their encounters,<br>
        though not personal, have been royally attorneyed<br>
        with interchange of gifts, letters, loving<br>
        embassies; that they have seemed to be together,<br>
        though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and<br>
        embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed<br>
        winds. The heavens continue their loves!<br></p>
    <h6 class="name ARCHIDAMUS">ARCHIDAMUS</h6><br>
    <p class="speech">
       I think there is not in the world either malice or<br>
       matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable<br>
       comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a<br>
       gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came<br>
       into my note.<br>
